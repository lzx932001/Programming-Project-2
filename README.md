# Programming-Project-2

This project is to examine the understanding of Data Structures and Patterns in both design and implementation on an actual application.

The required concepts are:
* Inheritance and Derived Classes
* Polymorphism
* Array
* Singly Linked-List
* Stack
* Queue
* Tree
* Abstract Data Type
* Visitor
* Prototype

This software prototype application is a simple Text-Based Simulator, player can interact with the
system via Text Input through the Command Line Interface. The concept of this software prototype
application came from Tycoon games, which is Business simulation games. Player can focus on the
management of economic processes. At the beginning, player has 10 monies on his hand, he needs
to work to get more money. By investing into worker or building, both of them will help player
generate money faster. Worker works different from building, after the player hired a worker, the
worker will work with the player together in one day, so the worker will only work once per day.
Also, the player only can have one worker at a time. But building is different, player has a Custom
ADT which is Land to store all the building he bought, so player can have multiple buildings at a same
time. The way buildings generate income is after player bought the building, the building will auto
generate money overnight. That is how we differentiate worker and building.

Since it is a Text-Based Simulator, it has no goal in the end of the game. Players can continue play it
until they want to quit, but be careful, the progress of the game will not save into a file and allow
player to continue from there.

This project is only for assignment purpose.
